Using Prism, I was thinking most of the validation processing would be automated underneath the hood.
That assumption was wrong, the examples given using the Prism was under the assumption that the data already existed, hence the clean interface.

The problem lies within the action itself to check whether an input is valid or not.
Currently found one solution

In order for triggers to occur inside the DataTemplate, it looks like you need to create the event.

What I want to have is a ListboxItem where:

1. When the leftbutton click event.
2. Triggers a event where it calls a command in ViewModel.
3. In the command, it calls a function that grabs the current selected ListBoxItem information, and compares the info at the same index in Tasks list.
4. If the isChecked, it sends back to the trigger event as true. True is changing the background colour to green.
5. If the new date selected is less than the current date, it sends back false. False is changing the background colour to red.


The optimial way to this is whenever the data changes in the ListBoxItem.
Rather than calling the function whenever the left button is clicked on an item, it'll execute when the data has changed.


Another way of handling this check is calling the command to update the database entry.
And having a ischecked event where it changes colour.
